      <p class="bolditalic">What is WeMAKE?
        It’s a gathering, it’s hands on, it’s about community.
        It’s a place where discoveries and new friendships are made.
        It’s raw, it’s insightful, it’s collaborative. </p>
      <p>WeMAKE is about making, making connections, make believing, and making a difference.
        
        Through hands on workshops, inspirational experiences, or arts advocacy through
    social change collaborations, WeMAKE invites you to come make it happen. </p></td>

      <p><span class="bold">What is SketchXChange?</span><br />
      A chance to peep into the sketchbooks of some of our favorite local illustrators. Hear what inspires their work and learn about the process they use to create. You'll bring your own sketchbook and mingle with other participants, have a beverage, and draw in a few sketchbooks. There are no rules, no themes (unless you have one for your book) just pens, pencils, sketchbooks, and friends. This isn't a slide show event, guest illustrators will be sharing their actual sketchbooks and you'll have an opportunity to purchase some of their work.</p>
      <p>So come join us for an intimate night amongst friends drawing. If you come to enough SketchXChanges you could potentially have a whole sketchbook filled with illustrations by many people in our community. One lucky participant will even get a drawing done in their sketchbook by the guest illustrator! Yay! </p>
    <p>Beginning in April, SketchXChange will happen every first Friday of the month starting with the talented<a href="http://marykatemcdevitt.com/"> Miss Marty Kate McDevitt</a></p></td>
